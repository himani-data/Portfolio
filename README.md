## 📚 What I Learned

While building this website, I explored and applied:

- 🧠 **Semantic HTML & CSS**  
  Learned how to structure and style a professional layout from scratch.

- 🎨 **Bootstrap Framework**  
  Leveraged Bootstrap classes to speed up UI development and ensure responsiveness.

- 🧩 **JavaScript & DOM Manipulation**  
  Built interactive components like progress bars and animated scrolls using vanilla JS.

- 🌐 **Git & GitHub Workflow**  
  Practiced the full Git workflow: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, setting remotes, and resolving errors like refspec mismatches.


- 🐛 **Debugging**  
  Solved real layout and version control issues — improving my patience and problem-solving mindset.
